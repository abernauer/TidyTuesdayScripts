# Introduction 

For this project I wanted to implement a machine learning model on a [TidyTuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) dataset. I don't have a lot of practical experience with classification tasks so I chose a data set that lended itself well to those algorithms. This machine learning task is a **supervised learning**  as the data already has labels assigned to it. 
I intially explored using several classification algorithms to train a model and classify the passwords; however as machine learning algorithms generally don't handle text data well I had to do some data preprocessing and transformation.
